# Hardware Accelerated Finite Element Analysis

Finite Element Analysis is a foundational tool for many engineers. Traditionally, if an engineer wants to do a calculation on the maximum amount of stress, strain, heat flux, etc. in a material or object, they would need to make simplifying assumptions until the object became amenable to hand calculations. Finite Element Analysis is a computational techniqe that allows analysis of parts with complex geometries, without any simplifying assumptions needing to be made. Engineers can design arbitrarily complex parts or systems, and be guaranteed that analysis is possible. 

This technique gave rise to the concept of generative design. Generative design is based on repeated application of FEA. A part is described by a set of constraints instead of definite geometry. Analysis is then performed on a block of material that fulfills the spacial constraints, and then material that isn't necessary for the load constraints is removed iteratively. Generative design has the potential to automate much of the engineering process. One significant downside is the amount of time it takes to perform FEA on a part. One part can take anywhere from 1 minute to several hours to analyze properly depending on precision needs.

Our goal is to perform analysis on a part in a few hundred or thousand clock cycles, rather than minutes or hours. To do this we designed a system to perform FEA using an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
